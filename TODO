1) Server (aka Service)
	-> Media Player FSM.
		-> Time tracking 
	-> Context getting stuff: 
		-> GPS coordinates. (background task)
		-> Weather (definitely background task + API call)
		-> Accelerometer? (maybe?)
		-> Current time / day of the week.
	-> Track music collection on filesystem. (polling at predefined intervals?)
		-> Give those tracks our own IDs + store in own DB.
	-> Separate service for ranking?
		-> sum (dot( current_gps_loc, trackpreviouslyplated_at_gps_loc)) for locations. (?)
	-> Ranks recomputed every hour?
		->  "Scrolling" playlist (? maybe not!)
	
2) Activity 
	-> Somehow trigger mood "dialog"/activity.
		-> Activate it using button or at predefined intervals (?) 

3) Common
	-> Proper Playlist datastructure
		-> Must point to currently playing track.
		-> Ability to choose previous / next tracks. (Linked list?)

4) DB Schemas
	-> When song finishes playing 
		-> (song_id, gps, user_mood, time, day_of_the_week, weather(temperature?), activity)
